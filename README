for version 1.5.1 - Tree and I18N

the PEAR::Tree and PEAR::I18N packages are included in the SimpleTemplate-1.5.1.tar.gz.
To install the Tree and/or I18N package simply unpack them and place them in your
include_path.
Unfortunately I am not able to upload a package yet on the pear-website
so the pear installer doesnt work yet for those packages!!!
I am working on it!


Installation

- unpack the SimpleTemplate-1.5.1.tar.gz-file
- place the directory 'SimpleTemplate' in your include path
- and you are all set
- i suggest to try the example first
