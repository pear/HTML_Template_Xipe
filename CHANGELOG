- TagLib: includeFile works like include_once now
- save the cache-generated files with mode 777
- added filterLevel 8 and 9

- create compiled tpl's and dirs with the right 777
- and many bugfixes

Version 1.5
 
Added caching of the final output, can be configured using XML inside the file or in a config file.
Changed the entire engine, to work properly on multiple tpl-files in one page, by creating an instance for each tpl-file internally.

ATTENTION: dont access properties directly anymore, use get-/set-methods! Especially for compiledTemplate, use getCompiledTemplate()-method.
Be sure to look at the examples.
