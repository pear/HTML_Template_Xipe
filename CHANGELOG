Version 1.5
 
Added caching of the final output, can be configured using XML inside the file or in a config file. 
Changed the entire engine, to work properly on multiple tpl-files in one page, by creating an instance for each tpl-file internally.

ATTENTION: dont access properties directly anymore, use get-/set-methods! Especially for compiledTemplate, use getCompiledTemplate()-method.
Be sure to look at the examples.
